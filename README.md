# Python Slot Machine

## Description  
A simple slot machine ran out the terminal, coded with python. 

## Tests  
To play the slot game please cloen the code into a SOMETHING and type "python main.py" into the bash terminal. The game will start with a few questions about how much one would like to deposit, what lines the bettor wants to bet on, and how much for each bet. The limit on max bet can be changed in line 4 of the code. 
The game will continue with spins until the bettor chooses to end the round by pressing q, once prompted after any given spin.
